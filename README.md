# VASP_tools
In this repository, you can find some tools designed to post-process the results of VASP simulations. These tools have been developed to support my personal projects.

TOOLS:
 - vasp_forces_main.py --> This script allows you to compare the forces between two relaxation steps.

#### DISCLAIMER: These tools are created according to the needs of my projects, so their usability and/or flexibility may be limited. These features can be improved over time, but it is not a priority at the moment.
